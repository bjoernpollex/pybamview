PyBamView is a python-based application that allows you to view BAM sequence alignments through your web browser. It was inspired by the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/samtools.shtml">samtools tview</a> tool, and was motivated by the need to better visualize alignments with complex insertions/deletions across multiple samples, which is not handled well by current broswers such as IGV and the UCSC Genome Browser.
</p>
<p>
<b>*New!*</b> You can now generate alignment snapshots automatically on the command line using the <code>snapbam</code> utility, described <a href="snapshots.html">here</a>.

PyBamView is run locally, without the need to upload large alignment/genome files to external sites, and provides text alignments that are fast and easy to navigate. Take a look at the <a href="http://bit.ly/pybamview-demo">example</a> and <a href="http://melissagymrek.com/python/2014/01/30/pybamview.html">my blog post</a> to learn more.
