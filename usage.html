	This page gives basic information on how to use PyBamView. To learn how to set up a web server to host a PyBamView instance, see <a href="serve-pybamview-remotely.html">Serving PyBamView remotely</a>. To automatically generate alignment snapshots on the command line, see <a href="snapshots.html">Generating PyBamView Snapshots</a>
	<h1>example command</h1>
	Here's an example command using files from the download to get you started. You can find the example data files <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/~gymrek/pybamview_example_data.tar.gz">here</a>. Keep reading for more detailed instructions.
	{% highlight bash %}
	pybamview --bam examples/example.sorted.bam
	{% endhighlight %}
	This will open a browser pointing to 127.0.0.1:5000. Try navigating to different genomic locations, e.g. chr11:2192266.
        <h1>getting started</h1>
	To get started with PyBamView, make sure you have a BAM file that has been <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/samtools.shtml">sorted and indexed using samtools</a>. Assuming you already have samtools installed, this requires two simple commands:
	{% highlight bash %}
	samtools sort mybam.bam mybam.sorted
	{% endhighlight %}
	{% highlight bash %}
	samtools index mybam.sorted.bam
	{% endhighlight %}
	Optionally, you can also provide a reference genome in fasta format. Then simply type:
	{% highlight bash %}
	pybamview --bam PATH/TO/BAM --ref REF.fasta
	{% endhighlight %}
	This will by default give you a localhost URL for port 5000. The default web browser will then be automatically opened pointing to 127.0.0.1:5000 and display the first reads it found in the BAM file.
	<p>
	Note, you can also use PyBamView to view alignments from multiple BAM files at once. To do this, use the "--bamdir" option to provide PyBamView with a directory. PyBamView will look for any indexed bams in that directory, detect which samples are in those bams, and display them as a checklist. If no samples are showing up, make sure you have indexed your bam files and that all reads are annotated with a read group (see <a href="http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/discussion/1317/collected-faqs-about-bam-files"> here for more information about read groups and BAM faq</a>). Select which samples you would like to view and click "View selected samples".
	<p>
	This will take you to a page visualizating the alignments. If you specified a reference genome, that will be displayed at the top of the alignments (else it will be all Ns). Below the reference is a section for each sample contained in the bam files. You can navigate to a specific genomic region by entering a location in the form "$chrom:position" (e.g. chr1:1000) in the box that says "Enter region". Mouse over a column to see which genomic position you're at. Use the zoom buttons to zoom in and out of the alignment view. Mouse over the question marks for usage tips.
	  <h1>exporting snapshots to PDF</h1>
	  PyBamView can easily export alignment snapshots to PDF format. When viewing an alignment, click the "Export snapshot" button on the top left. This will open a new window where you can tweak the alignment display. When you're happy with the region and samples selected, click "Download PDF" to obtain the PDF file.
	  <h1>viewing a set of target regions</h1>
	  If you're interested in a specific set of target regions (for instance, Y-STRs), you can upload a bed file containing these targets using the "--targets" option. An example targets file is included in the <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/~gymrek/pybamview_example_data.tar.gz">example data files</a>. Then you'll see a drop down box on the alignment page that will allow you to quickly navigate to a marker of interest.
	  <h1>full command line usage</h1>
	To see the usage information for PyBamView, type:
	{% highlight bash %}
>pybamview --help
Usage: pybamview [options]

pybamview: An Python-based BAM alignment viewer.

Options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --bam=BAM          Run Pybamview on this BAM file only. The file must be
                     indexed.
  --bamdir=BAMDIR    Directory to look for bam files. Bam files must be
                     indexed.
  --ref=REF          Path to reference fasta file. If no reference is given,
                     the reference track is displayed as Ns
  --ip=IP            Host IP. 127.0.0.1 for local host (default). 0.0.0.0 to
                     have the server available externally.
  --port=PORT        The port of the webserver. Defaults to 5000.
  --targets=TARGETS  Bed file with chrom, start, end, and name. Allows you to
                     easily jump to these targets.
  --buffer=BUFFER    How many nucleotides to load into memory. Default: 200.
                     Buffering more allows you to scroll farther. Buffering
                     less is faster.
  --maxzoom=MAXZOOM  Maximum number of times to be able to zoom out. E.g.
                     --maxzoom 10 allows zooming out up to 10x. Default: 100.
                     Must be between one of 1-10, 50, or 100.
  --no-browser       Do not automatically open the web browser.
  --debug            Run PyBamView in Flask debug mode
